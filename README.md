# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Collection of projects based on different machine learning algorithms. 

1. **Linear Regression**: A linear regression model used to predict **Prices(USD)** of houses in a specific neighborhood based on features **neighborhood,area,construction_year,rooms_count,floor,total_floors_count,unit_per_floor,has_elevator,has_parking,has_warehouse** *(mashhad_apartment_sales_2024 dataset)*
2. **Logistic Regression**: A Logistic Regressian model used to predict whether a paitent will have **10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease** depending on features **male,age,education,currentSmoker,cigsPerDay,BPMeds,prevalentStroke,prevalentHyp,diabetes,totChol,sysBP,diaBP,BMI,heartRate,glucose** *(Framingham Heart Study dataset)*
3. **Polynomial Regression**: A simple Polynomial Regression model used to predict **Quality rating** of a manufacturing process based on features **Temperature (°C),Pressure (kPa),Temperature x Pressure,Material Fusion Metric,Material Transformation Metric** using pipeline of *StandardScaler* and *PolynomialFeatures* *(manufacturing dataset)*


Remember to install the required libraries given in require before running the projects:  
Run in terminal:```pip install -r requirements.txt```
